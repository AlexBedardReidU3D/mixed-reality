Welcome to Mixed Reality documentation, the place for all things MR, VR, and AR at Microsoft!

## Contributing

If you're contributing or updating docs content, make sure your pull requests are targeting the correct sub-docset (mr-dev-docs, enthusiast-guide, and so on). 

To ensure that your PR receives the attention it needs and is merged as soon as it's ready, make sure you're familiar with our [submission guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/MRDocumentation/Ed-LEaqIjJZGkwQwFkhZuGUB8d1q0Mq8GyyLy_xdTVrQaA?e=Jh3Rzc). Here's a brief summary of the guidlines:

1. Apply a label to your PR or choose "Draft" mode to convey the current status. Update as the PR evolves.

    **Draft mode**: you're still pushing commits and aren't ready for reviews.

    Label **"MR: Ready for review"**: you're finished pushing commits and want the PR to be reviewed.

    Label **"MR: Ready for merge"**: you're satisfied that the tech review process has been completed and are ready to have the PR copyedit-reviewed and merged.

    The "MR" in the label indicates that your PR is for "Mixed Reality."

1. Choose the technical reviewers for your PR. A copyedit review by a tech writer will be performed on each PR before merging.

For docs-related issues, use the footers at the bottom of each doc, or submit directly to [MicrosoftDocs/mixed-reality/issues](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mixed-reality/issues).

Feel free to send any questions about contribution policies or processes to Harrison Ferrone or Sean Kerawala via Teams or email. 

## Getting started 

Every path through our docs has a curated journey to help you find your footing. Whether it's design, development, or distributing your apps to the world, we've got you covered. 

### Mixed Reality for HoloLens

We recommend starting with the **Mixed Reality basics** and moving on from there:

If you're interested in the **design** side of things:

* [Start designing and prototyping](mixed-reality-docs/mr-dev-docs/design/design.md)

When you're ready to start **developing**, choose the engine and device that best suits your needs:

* [Introduction to Mixed Reality development](mixed-reality-docs/mr-dev-docs/develop/development.md)

For engine-specific content, choose one of the following paths:

* [Unity development overview](mixed-reality-docs/mr-dev-docs/develop/unity/unity-development-overview.md)
