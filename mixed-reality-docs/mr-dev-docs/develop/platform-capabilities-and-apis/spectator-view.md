# Spectator View for HoloLens and HoloLens 2

Microsoft will be deprecating the Spectator View sample due to incompatibilities with the version of the Azure Spatial Anchors SDK package that the sample relies on.

Additionally, we have some concerns that other aspects of the sample may cease to work due to other changes in the Unity environment as customers move to supported 2019 LTS builds.
