# Choosing a Unity version and XR plugin

While we currently **recommend installing Unity 2020.3 LTS with the Mixed Reality OpenXR plugin** for Mixed Reality development, you can build apps with other Unity configurations as well.

## Unity 2020.3 LTS (Recommended)

Microsoftâ€™s current recommended Unity configuration for HoloLens 2 and Windows Mixed Reality development is **Unity 2020.3 LTS with the Mixed Reality OpenXR plugin**.

[!INCLUDE[](includes/xr/recommended-version.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Unity 2020 does not support targeting HoloLens (1st gen). These headsets remain supported in **[Unity 2019 LTS](#unity-20194-lts)** with Legacy Built-in XR for the full lifecycle of Unity 2019 LTS through mid-2022.

The best way to install and manage Unity is through the **Unity Hub**:

1. Install <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download" target="_blank">**Unity Hub**</a>.
2. Select the **Installs** tab and choose **Add**.
3. Select **Unity 2020.3 LTS** and click **Next**.

4. Check the following components under **'Platforms'**:
    * **Universal Windows Platform Build Support**
    * **Windows Build Support (IL2CPP)**

5. If you previously installed Unity without these options, you can add them through **'Add Modules'** menu in Unity Hub:

Once you have Unity 2020.3 installed, get started creating a project or upgrading an existing project using the Mixed Reality OpenXR plugin:

> [Set up your project with the OpenXR plugin](xr-project-setup.md?tabs=openxr)

> [!NOTE]
> While we recommend using OpenXR for all new projects, Unity 2020.3 LTS also supports the [Windows XR plugin](xr-project-setup.md?tabs=windowsxr). This plugin is fully supported, although it won't receive new features such as AR Foundation 4.0 support.

## Unity 2019.4 LTS

If you need to use Unity 2019, you can use **Unity 2019 LTS with Legacy Built-in XR**. To get started with Legacy Built-in XR in Unity 2019.4 LTS, click here:

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Set up your project with Legacy Built-in XR](xr-project-setup.md?tabs=legacy)

> [!NOTE]
> Unity has deprecated its Legacy Built-in XR support as of Unity 2019.  While Unity 2019 does offer a new XR Plug-in framework, Microsoft is not currently recommending that path in Unity 2019 due to Azure Spatial Anchors incompatibilities with AR Foundation 2.  In Unity 2020, Azure Spatial Anchors is supported within the XR Plug-in framework.

If you are developing apps for HoloLens (1st gen), these headsets remain supported in Unity 2019 LTS with Legacy Built-in XR for the full lifecycle of Unity 2019 LTS through mid-2022.

## Unity 2021.2

If you are trying out early **Unity 2021.2** builds, get started with the [**Mixed Reality OpenXR plugin**](xr-project-setup.md?tabs=openxr). The OpenXR plugin is the only path for mixed reality development in Unity 2021.2 and later, as the final Unity version to support the Windows XR plugin was Unity 2021.1.

[!INCLUDE[](includes/xr/recommended-version.md)]

## Unity 2018.4 LTS

Unity 2018.4 LTS has reached the end of Unity's two-year Long-Term Support window and is no longer receiving updates from Unity, although your projects will continue to run.

If you have a Unity 2018 project, you should consider planning for a migration forward to Unity 2020.3 LTS and the Mixed Reality OpenXR plugin.
