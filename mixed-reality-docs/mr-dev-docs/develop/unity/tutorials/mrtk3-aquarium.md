# MRTK3 Aquarium

:::image type="content" source="images/MRTK3-Aquarium.png" alt-text="MRTK3 Aquarium scene.":::

The MRTK3 Aquarium sample provides a Unity in-editor tutorial that explores various MRTK3 features. Set in an underwater scene, you'll be introduced to the creatures of the aquarium and the objects that make up their habit. Using MRTK3 features, you'll add interactivity to the aquarium which will enable you to create an aquarium of your very own!

In this sample, you'll learn how to do the following:
- Manipulate and arrange objects in the aquarium
- Add bounding boxes to objects in the aquarium
- Create buttons to spawn objects in the aquarium
- Create dynamic UI to organize scene controls
- Add a confirmation dialog to confirm actions
- Configure theming options to change the look of the scene UI controls
