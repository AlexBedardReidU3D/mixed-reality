# Introduction to Mixed Reality development

![Abstract 3D sphere](images/development-hero-image.png)

Mixed Reality is a big place, where real and virtual worlds collide with a bang. The possibilities are endless, and it starts with you. Choose your engine, download your tools, and dust off your keyboard. Welcome to the Mixed Reality ecosystem--it's time to create.

We have three possible paths for starting out in Mixed Reality development. Each is described below:
* [New to Mixed Reality Development? Get started here](#microsoft-learn)
* [Mixed Reality Toolkit tutorial series](#mixed-reality-toolkit-tutorials)
* [Self-guided exploration](#self-guided-exploration)

## New to Mixed Reality Development?

### Learn the concepts, products and services

Start at the very beginning with an overview of what Mixed Reality is and how it differs from Virtual and Augmented Reality. Learn about the HoloLens, immersive headsets, and holograms. Explore basic design and develop concepts and related technologies such as Azure Remote Rendering.

### Start building a Mixed Reality Experience

### 
Are you already an intermediate-to-advanced developer with some experience in Mixed, Augmented, or Virtual Reality? We'll help you choose the proper tools and get set up, if needed, and then we'll direct you to our curated development paths across Unity, Unreal, Native, or Web

## Mixed Reality Toolkit tutorials

If you're more of a learn-by-doing user, check out our Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) tutorial series. You'll build a mixed reality experience where the user can explore a hologram modeled after NASA's Mars Curiosity Rover and get a firm grasp of MRTK and how it can speed up your development process.

## Self-guided exploration

If you're a seasoned developer and want to get right into our docs, start by installing the required tools. From there, choose your Unity development setup and follow our curated Unity development path with HoloLens or browse around our content library.
