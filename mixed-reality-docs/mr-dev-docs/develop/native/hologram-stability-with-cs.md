# Hologram stability in DirectX

For an overview of hologram stability, including some DirectX tips, we recommend that you take a look at our [hologram stability overview](../platform-capabilities-and-apis/hologram-stability-overview.md) article. The sections of the page that contain the DirectX tips are linked below.

[Reprojection](../platform-capabilities-and-apis/hologram-stability-overview.md#reprojection)

[Choosing reprojection technique](../platform-capabilities-and-apis/hologram-stability-overview.md#choosing-reprojection-technique)

[Using planar reprojection](../platform-capabilities-and-apis/hologram-stability-overview.md#using-planar-reprojection) (This sections also contains C# sample code.)
