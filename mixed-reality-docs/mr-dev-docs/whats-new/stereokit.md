Learn to build mixed reality applications for HoloLens 2 or any OpenXR-compliant device using C#, Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, and StereoKit. Join the [Mixed Reality challenge](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/mixed-reality-blog/mixedrealitychallenge-stereokit/ba-p/2898397) to find out, get access to support, and enter for a chance to win. 

## What is StereoKit?

[StereoKit](https://stereokit.net/) is a code-first and open-source library for building mixed reality (MR) experiences using C# and [OpenXR](/windows/mixed-reality/develop/native/openxr). It addresses some of the most common and challenging aspects of Mixed Reality development including UI, inputs, interactions, physics, shaders/material systems, working with text, asset loading, and much more. Mixed Reality projects can be viewed on HoloLens 2, desktop, or any VR device that uses the OpenXR runtime, for example: Oculus Quest, Windows Mixed Reality, and etc.

## How do I participate in the hackathon?

Build a new open-source HoloLens 2 or VR application, game, or experience prototype using StereoKit. You can participate as an individual or as part of a team\*. 

The submitted project must be capable of being successfully installed and running consistently on the platform, HoloLens 2 Emulator, or the Windows Mixed Reality Simulator for which it is intended. The project must function as depicted in your submission description and demo video. 

For more information about the hackathon, see [rules for full details on project and submission requirements](https://mixed-reality-stereokit.devpost.com/rules).  

\* *Teams may be made up of up to five (5) eligible individuals.*
