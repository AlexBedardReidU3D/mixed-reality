# Roadmap

This document outlines our vision for major work in the Mixed Reality Toolkit for calendar year 2021 and 2022. Please note that the following reflects work that is in development and target dates reflect estimates.

## Current release

Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit v2.7.2

## Upcoming releases

| Product | Description | Timeline | Project board |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [MRTK v2.7.3](#273) | A minor release with targeted bug fixes | Dec 2021 | [MRTK v2.7.3 Milestones](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/milestone/25) |
| [MRTK v3.0.0 Public Preview](#300) | A new major release of the MRTK on an all new architecture | Spring 2022 |[MRTK v3.0.0 Milestones](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/milestone/18) |
| [MRTK v2.8.0](#280) | Next iteration of MRTK with bug fixes and minor improvements | Spring 2022 | [MRTK v2.8.0 Milestones](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/milestone/22) |

The MRTK team is currently focused on developing MRTK v3 which introduces a new architecture to address several painpoints that have been vocalized by the community. Since we are a lean team, we are moving away from our typical 8-12 week release cadence in order to focus our attention on building up the core of MRTK v3 so we can share it with the public and start accepting contributions from the community.

Release details, including backlog items, can be found on the [GitHub milestone pages](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/milestones). The complete set of open issues can also be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/issues).


> When Unity releases an LTS (Long Term Support) product, the Mixed Reality Toolkit will update to the LTS release. Although the Mixed Reality Toolkit runs on the latest non-beta (ex: 2021.2) tech branch version of Unity, it is not officially supported.

## Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) roadmap

### **2.7.3**
In December 2021, MRTK 2.7.3 will release to address important bugs that have been reported on github. 

Status: In Development

Target Time: Early December 2021

### **3.0.0**
In the spring of 2022, a preview of MRTK v3 will release featuring an all new architecture for developing rich MR experiences. MRTK v3 will have new minimum requirements which include: 
- Unity 2020.3 LTS 
- Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit (XRI)
- OpenXR

Status: In Development

Target Time: Public Preview Spring 2022

Our focuses for MRTK v3 include the following:
- Independent subsystems that can easily be integrated with non-MRTK code
- Performance Improvements
- Components ready for enterprise scale
- Cross-platform device support
- Flexible and Scalable Layout Tools
- Data Driven UI
- Themeing System to Quickly Apply Your Brand to UI
- Accessibility Options


### **2.8.0**

As we transition to MRTK v3, MRTK v2 will go into maintenance mode. This means the MRTK team will prioritize bug fixes and stability over new feature development in MRTK 2.8 and later. We continue to encourage the developer community to take advantage of the open source nature of MRTK and submit PR's for new features you would like to you. We also encourage the community to comment in the [MRTK github repo](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/issues) on issues you want to see fixed first.

Status: Gathering Feedback

Target Timeline: Spring 2022

Themes:

- Unity 2021 Support
- Bug Fixes
