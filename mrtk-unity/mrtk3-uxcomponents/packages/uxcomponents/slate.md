# Slate -- MRTK3

![Slate](../../../mrtk3-overview/images/UXBuildingBlocks/MRTK_UX_v3_Slate.png)

The Slate prefab offers a thin window-style control for displaying 2D content, such as plain text and images. It offers a grabbable title bar and *Close* functionality. 

For smaller, simpler collections of UI, consider using a [near menu](near-menu.md) instead.
