# UX Components &#8212; MRTK3

This package contains an extensive library of pre-built UX prefabs ready for use in your mixed reality applications.

If you would like to only consume the underlying UX scripts (for example, if you're building your own custom UX component libraries) you should only take a dependency on the [UX Core](../../../mrtk3-uxcore/packages/uxcore/overview.md) package. The UX Core package doesn't include any dependencies on our assets, visuals, or solvers, which is ideal for building your own custom UX components and minimizing the total number of dependencies pulled into your project.

The UX Components package includes ready-to-use prefabs for [Canvas](../../../mrtk3-uxcore/packages/uxcore/canvas-ui.md) layout environments. These prefabs implement the new [Mixed Reality Design Language](mixed-reality-design-language.md).
