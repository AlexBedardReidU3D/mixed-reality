> In the majority of cases, the hybrid Canvas UI prefabs offer a much more powerful designer workflow, with dynamic resizing, reflow, alignment, padding, realtime layouts, and more. [Learn more about how the hybrid Canvas UI system works.](../../../mrtk3-uxcore/packages/uxcore/canvas-ui.md). These prefabs are located in the com.microsoft.mrtk.uxcomponents package.
