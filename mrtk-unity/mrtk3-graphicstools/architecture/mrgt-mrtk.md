# Connection between Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) to Graphics Tools

The MRTK is authored as a collection of [Unity packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PackagesList.html) that can be chosen Ã  la carte. Some developers will chose to use all of MRTK's packages, while others will need only a subset. When choosing a subset Unity's package manager will automatically pull in dependencies outline by a package. Graphics Tools sits as substrate to many MRTK packages, especially if the package requires contains any visual displayed to the user (materials, shaders, etc.).

Due to the dependency described above, many MRTK packages depend on Graphics Tools and Graphics Tools does not depend on any other MRTK packages.

## Dependencies

Graphics Tools only depends on Unity packages (and no other third party packages). The list of Unity dependencies can be found on the editor and runtime assembly definitions.

Most features within Graphics Tools work with Unity's built-in render pipeline or [Universal Render Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@11.0/manual/)(URP). If a script requires the URP be installed within the project it is wrapped in the `GT_USE_URP` preprocessor. Similarly, all shader code that requires the URP is conditionally compiled with the following syntax:

```HLSL
PackageRequirements
{
    "com.unity.render-pipelines.universal": "x.y.z"
}  
```
