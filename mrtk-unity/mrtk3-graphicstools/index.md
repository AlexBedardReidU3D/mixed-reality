# What is the Mixed Reality Graphics Tools

![MRTK Banner](images/MRTKBanner.png)

Graphics tools and components for developing Mixed Reality applications in Unity.

> **_NOTE:_** This package is an evolution of the [MRTK/Standard shader system](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/mrtk-unity/features/rendering/mrtk-standard-shader?view=mrtkunity-2021-05) and other components. The equivalent of the `MRTK/Standard` shader within Graphics Tools is the `Graphics Tools/Standard` shader. New features have been added to better support Unity UI and the new Mixed Reality Design System.

> **_NOTE:_** Graphics Tools requires Unity 2020.x and above.
