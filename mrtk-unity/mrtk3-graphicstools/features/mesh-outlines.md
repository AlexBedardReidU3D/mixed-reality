# Mesh outlines

Many mesh outline techniques are done using a [post processing](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PostProcessingOverview.html) technique. Post processing provides great quality outlines, but can be prohibitively expensive on many Mixed Reality devices.

`MeshOutline.cs` and `MeshOutlineHierarchy.cs` can be used to render an outline around a mesh renderer. Enabling this component introduces an additional render pass of the object being outlined, but is designed to run performantly on mobile Mixed Reality devices and does not utilize any post processes.

> [!NOTE]
> Limitations of this effect include it not working well on objects which are not watertight (or required to be two sided) and depth sorting issues can occur on overlapping objects.

## Sample

See the "Mesh Outlines" sample for demonstrations of the outline system.

## Material setup

The outline behaviors are designed to be used in conjunction with the Graphics Tools/Standard shader. Outline materials are usually a solid unlit color, but can be configured to achieve a wide array of effects. The default configuration of a outline material is as follows:

1. Depth Write - should be disabled for outline materials to make sure the outline does not prevent other objects from rendering.
2. Vertex Extrusion - needs to be enabled to render the outline.
3. Use Smooth Normals - this setting is optional for some meshes. Extrusion occurs by moving a vertex along a vertex normal, on some meshes extruding along the default normals will cause discontinuities in the outline. To fix these discontinuities, you can check this box to use another set of smoothed normals which get generated by `MeshSmoother.cs`.

## Mesh smoothing

`MeshSmoother.cs` is a component which can be used to automatically generate smoothed normals on a mesh. This method groups vertices in a mesh that share the same location in space then averages the normals of those vertices. This process creates a copy of the underlying mesh and should be used only when required.

In the above image cube 1 is utilizing mesh smoothing while cube 2 is not. Notice the discontinuities at the corners of the cube without mesh smoothing.

> [!TIP]
> Certain meshes (like spheres) do not display these discontinuities. So it is best to test which meshes need mesh smoothing and which do not.
