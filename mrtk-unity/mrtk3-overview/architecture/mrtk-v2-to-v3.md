# MRTK2 to MRTK3 concept migration guide

As you begin using MRTK3, you'll notice that several concepts in MRTK v2 have been changed, replaced, or removed. This is because MRTK3 uses Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit (XRI) framework to handle interaction, and the Unity Input System plus OpenXR for input. This document will help bridge the gap between MRTK v2 concepts and their MRTK3 counterparts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For developers new to XRI, we recommend that you first review Unity's [XRI architecture documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@2.0/manual/architecture.html). All XRI documentation also applies to MRTK3, as most interaction and input features are simply inherited from XRI.

## Terminology

| MRTK v2 term | MRTK3 term | Description |
| ------------ | -------- | ----------- |
| Pointer | Interactor | [Interactors](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@2.0/api/UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.XRBaseInteractor.html) perform interactions on **Interactables**. Some (but not all) Interactors are driven by Controllers, from which they receive input actions and poses. Other Interactors operate independently of controllers. <br><br> MRTK ships several custom Interactors that provide useful mixed reality interactions on top of the basic Interactors Unity already provides. Custom interactors can be built either through inheritance or by implementing the Interactor interfaces (`IXRHoverInteractor`, `IXRSelectInteractor`, and so forth). See the [Interactor architecture documentation](interactors.md) for more information.
| `NearInteractionGrabbable, NearInteractionTouchable, IMixedRealityPointerHandler` | Interactable | [Interactables](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@2.0/api/UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.XRBaseInteractable.html) are the recipients of interactions. MRTK ships several custom Interactables that provide useful mixed reality interactions on top of the basic Interactables Unity already provides. Interactables can be built either through inheritance or by implementing the interactable interfaces (`IXRHoverInteractable`, `IXRSelectInteractable`, and so forth). See the [Interactable architecture documentation](interactables.md) for more information on how MRTK extends XRI interactables. |
| Controller | Controller | An [ActionBasedController](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@2.0/manual/xr-controller-action-based.html) is a collection of Unity Input Actions representing the bindings associated with a particular device. The collection of Input Actions can be derived from multiple devices, as there isn't a 1:1 relationship between `ActionBasedControllers` and underlying input devices. (A `DeviceBasedController` is a 1:1 mapping of an input device, but we don't use them.) <br><br> Many interactors (`ControllerBasedInteractor`s, specifically) listen to Controllers for input actions--in other words, all `ControllerBasedInteractor`s underneath an XRController will share the same select action. |
| Teleport System | Locomotion System | The [Locomotion System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@2.0/manual/locomotion-system.html) allows the user to move about the scene during an XR experience. MRTK v2's system allows for basic teleportation and teleport hotspots, with a high degree of customizability for the teleport cursor and pointer behavior. XRI offers the following added capabilities for locomotion: <br> <ul> <li> A Snap Turn Provider that rotates the rig by fixed angles </li> <li> A Continuous Turn Provider that smoothly rotates the rig over time </li> <li> A Continuous Move Provider that smoothly moves the rig over time </li> </ul> |
| Focus Provider | XR Interaction Manager | The [XRInteractionManager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@2.0/manual/xr-interaction-manager.html) is the Unity mechanism that serves as the intermediary between the **Interactors** and **Interactables** in the scene. The Unity `XRInteractionManager` synchronizes and arbitrates all interactions between Interactors and Interactables, and allows for significantly greater flexibility when compared to the legacy Focus Provider. |
| Pointer Mediator | Interaction Mode Manager | The new **Interaction Mode Manager** is used to enable/disable sets of interactors depending on context within the scene. See the [mode manager documentation](../../mrtk3-input/packages/input/interaction-mode-manager.md) for more information. |
| SceneQuerymask | Interaction Layers | XRI [interaction layers](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@2.0/manual/interaction-layers.html) allow developers to filter which Interactors can act upon which Interactables. These layers are distinct from Unity physics layers. |
| Focus | Hover  | Interactors issue **Hovers** on Interactables when the Interactable is a valid target for the Interactor. Generally, a Hover indicates intent from the interactor, such as targeting with a ray, hand proximity for grab, or if the user is looking at the object. |
| Select/Poke/Grab/Voice etc. | Select | Interactors issue **Selects** on Interactables when the Interactable is both a valid target and the Interactor chooses to do so. ControllerBasedInteractors generally emit Selects when their corresponding Controller's select input action fires. Other interactors can have more complex logic for determining when selects should be issued to the targeted Interactable. <br> <br> MRTK v2 handled different kinds of interactions with separate events and codepaths--in othr words, a grab was a fundamentally different interaction than a ray click or poke, generated by separate systems. In MRTK3, all of these ways of "selecting" an object are unified under the same **Select** interaction. <br> <br> We strongly discourage developers from building interaction logic that relies on a specific type of interaction; instead, write generalizable code that responds generically to all Selects. This way, your interactions work across all input modalities, and even for types of interactions that have yet to be developed. See the [Interactable architecture](interactables.md) for further reading on why we discourage this course. |
| N/A | Activate | **Activate** is an extra action that can be raised on an object that has already been Selected. For instance, if a user Selects a squirt gun with the grip of the controller, the trigger fires it with an Activate action.  |
| Data Provider | XRSubsystem + Provider | Most data providers are no longer necessary in MRTK3, since the Unity Input System and OpenXR handle most cross-platform input tasks. However, for some outliers that aren't yet covered by Unity, we provide `XRSubsystem`s that can provide data across different platforms--for example, `HandsAggregatorSubsystem` and `SpeechSubsystem`. See the [subsystems architecture documentation](subsystems.md) for more conceptual reading on our subsystems approach. |

## Events

| MRTK v2 term | XRI term | Notes |
| ------------ | -------- | ----------- |
| `OnFocusEnter/Exit`	| `FirstHoverEnter`<br>`LastHoverExit` | Note the `First` and `Last` prefixes; this is because any number of Interactors can simultaneously hover an Interactable. You can also listen to each individual hover enter/exit with `HoverEnter` and `HoverExit`, although it's generally less useful than monitoring the overall hover status. |
| `OnPointerDown/Up`  | `FirstSelectEnter`<br>`LastSelectExit` | Note the `First` and `Last` prefixes; this is due to the fact that any number of Interactors can simultaneously select an Interactable (depending on the selection mode). You can also listen to each individual select enter/exit with `SelectEnter` and `SelectExit`, although it's less useful than monitoring the overall selection status.|
| `OnPointerDragged`  | N/A  | Simply poll the `interactorsSelecting` attach transforms with `GetAttachTransform` during a selection. Bear in mind that, depending on the selection mode of the Interactable, an unbounded number of Interactors can select (and manipulate) an Interactable. |
| `OnSourcePoseChanged, OnSourceDetected, OnSourceLost` | N/A | XRI doesn't raise these events. They are handled via the **XRController** monitoring its associated **Input Device**.  |
