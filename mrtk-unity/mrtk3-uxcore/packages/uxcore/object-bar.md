# Object Bar

`ObjectBar` is a legacy component for arranging non-Canvas-based UI along a single axis. In the vast majority of cases, you should use Canvas-based UX controls for flexible layout along multiple axes.

For examples of how to build flexible and reusable ObjectBar-like layouts in Canvas, see the `CanvasUITearsheet.unity` example scene in our template project.

## Non-UI

`ObjectBar` can still be useful when arranging objects that are not UI-related, or cannot exist within the Canvas layout system.
