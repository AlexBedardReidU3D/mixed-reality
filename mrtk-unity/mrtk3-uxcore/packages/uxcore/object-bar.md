# Object Bar

`ObjectBar` is a simple component for arranging *non-Canvas-based* UI along a single axis. **In the vast majority of cases,** you should use Canvas-based UX controls for flexible layout along multiple axes.

See [Button Group](../../../mrtk3-uxcomponents/packages/uxcomponents/button-group.md) for examples of how to build flexible and responsive ObjectBar-like layouts in Canvas. The `CanvasUITearsheet.unity` example scene in our template project demonstrates how these layouts are built.

## Non-UI

`ObjectBar` can still be useful when arranging objects that are not UI-related, or cannot exist within the Canvas layout system.
